### Assignment Instructions: 
For this project, the students will;
* find a data set of their choosing
* get approval from the instructor to use that data set
* upon approval, find another (related) data set
* join the new data set with the original one to create an "enriched" data set
* perform an open-ended Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the enriched data set

Regarding the last bullet, "open-ended" means the student chooses the EDA that is performed. The student should have at least three types of data analysis (e.g., mean, standard deviation) and at least three types of graphs (e.g., historgram, bar graph). The student will explain why those variables were chosen for numerical or graphical analysis. Finally, the student will make note of any unusual values for any variable that is analyzed.


Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks. Karamoja (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

In Karamoja, several NGOs provide technical support as well as farm inputs to the farmers experiencing extremely low yield. Though, they lack visibility into the overall state of the region and often need to rely on some very local sources of information to prioritize their activities.
Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) has been requested to develop a new food security monitoring tool to support the decision making of one of those NGOs active in Karamoja.

To do so, Dalberg Data Insights developed a methodology to remotely measure the yield of the two main staple crops of the region (i.e. sorghum and maize) based on satellite images. The agri-tech team just ran the model for the 2017 crop season.

Research Question
As a Data Analyst, the agri-tech team is asking you to develop an interactive visualization tool of the results for this first crop season. This visualization tool that you will develop will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring tool that DDI will develop for the NGO.
Based on your experience, the team expects you to come up with a first draft within the coming 3 working days. They give you carte blanche in terms of structure and functionalities but they know that the client wants:
At least a map in the dashboard
The possibility of visualizing the results by district or sub-county (two administrative levels used by the NGO)
Dataset Files

Yield and Population per Subcounty
POP: total population for the subcounty
S_Yield_Ha: average yield for sorghum for the subcounty (Kg/Ha)
M_Yield_Ha: average yield for maize for the subcounty (Kg/Ha)
Crop_Area_Ha: total crop area for the subcounty (Ha)
S_Area_Ha: total sorghum crop area for the subcounty (Ha)
M_Area_Ha: total maize crop area for the subcounty (Ha)
S_Prod_Tot: total productivity for the sorghum for the subcounty (Kg)
M_Prod_Tot: total productivity for the maize for the subcounty (Kg)
